# Sales-Report
## Introduction
A sales report is a document that summarizes a business's sales activities over a specific period. Here it includes information on sales volume, revenue, and costs, analyzing the data along each step of the sales funnel to indicate sales team performance or any gaps therein. Sales reports are crucial for businesses as they provide insights into sales methodology successes, predictions of future sales data, analyses of performance compared to previous periods, and a greater understanding of customer motivations. This report can help a company modify its sales approach and other growth initiatives, making them essential tools for decision-making and strategic planning.
